### Overview

For this exercise, please use the following dataset of meerkat users.

```javascript
const meerkats=[
    {name: "Aleksandr", age: 30},
    {name: "Sergei", age:77},
    {name: "Maiya", age: 25},
    {name: "Meer Kat", age: 25},
    {name: "Oleg", age: 5},
    {name: "Hannah", age: 20}
];
```

This exercise is split into multiple steps. Each step will require you to add or extract some information from the Meerkats dataset and print it on the console.

### Step 1
Create a variable with a new Meerkat, and add it to the above array of Meerkats.

### Step 2
Remove from the list any Meerkat who is under the age of 10.

### Step 3
Replace the names of all Meerkats to be all lower case letters and no spaces between their names.

### Step 3
Add up the total age of all the meerkats in the list.

### Step 4
Print the name of any Meerkat whose name is a Palindrome.

### Step 5
Arrange the list of Meerkets by age, lowest to highest.
